Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.0 (unreleased)
-------------------------------------------------

 * First separate release of GpgME++.

 * cmake: The gpgme++ folder containing the header files is no longer exported
   as include directory. All headers have to be included with the prefix
   gpgme++/ now.

 * New function Context::generateRandomBytes to get cryptographically
   strong random bytes from gpg.  [T6694]

 * New function Context::generateRandomValue to get a cryptographically
   strong unsigned integer random value.  [T6694]

 * Removed the TrustItem listing functionality which used GpgME's trustlist
   feature which worked only for a short period in 2003.  [T4834]
